Name: Peyton Tessman 

1.We've been talking about GitHub and how it relates to R/R Studio. What is your takeaway from today's class?
 
 From Today's class, my take away is that GitHub is a colabrative Resource for sharing code with other colaborators, and keeping version history of projects
 or code. GitHub is also similar to R studio, in that it is a user friendly interface in order to utilize Git, the on computer language/package
 
2. What is one question that you still have ?

When multiple changes happen at different times, how often does it create bugs/issues to recombine different collaborator's code?
