1.We've been talking about GitHub and how it relates to R/R Studio. What is your takeaway from today's class?
 Git is on your computer, GitHub is on the cloud, these can be linked but we're only using GitHub in our class.
 
2. What is one question that you still have ?
Its starting to make sense I think I just need practice and more questions will come as we go along.
