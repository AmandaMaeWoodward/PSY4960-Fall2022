Name: Aspen Holm

1.We've been talking about GitHub and how it relates to R/R Studio. What is your takeaway from today's class?
My takeaway from today's class is that GitHub is ideal for collaborating in research and for version control.
 
2. What is one question that you still have ?
I am currently in a state of general confusion about GitHub, but one specific question I have is how does a fork differ from a branch? Is there any reason to use a fork other than if you're editing someone else's work when you're not a collaborator?
