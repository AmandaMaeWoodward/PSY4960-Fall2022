Name: Lucille 

1.We've been talking about GitHub and how it relates to R/R Studio. What is your takeaway from today's class?
My takeaway is that a fork is like a branch that only the owner can push onto the main repository and a branch is a version that anyone can push onto the main repository
2. What is one question that you still have ?
Can we have a quick tutorial on the access settings or how being a collaborator changes our view?
