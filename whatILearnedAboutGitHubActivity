1.We've been talking about GitHub and how it relates to R/R Studio. What is your takeaway from today's class?
 Git hub is incredibly confusing and im scared and also kind of lost, but this is fun and interesting to learn about ( I am going to stay optimistic :-).)
2. What is one question that you still have ?
 I think I am just confused about the process because it is a lot of everything all at the same time.
